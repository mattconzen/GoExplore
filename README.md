# GoExplore - A Lost Cities CLI clone written in Go

This is a personal learning project, and my first project in Go. These notes, and this project, should be considered a WIP and may never be complete.

Notes:
 - Card objects contain two properties: Color and Number
 - A deck needs to be instantiated with numbers 1-10 for each color
 - Each player should receive 8 cards, randomly, from the deck
 - Four card collections: P1.Hand, P2.Hand, Deck, Board
 - P1.Score and P2.Score should return the current score

Color should be implemented at some time.

Can Go objects have print representations like Elixir objects? Perhaps I should just write this in Elixir :)
